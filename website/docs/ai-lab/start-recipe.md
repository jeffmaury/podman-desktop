# Starting an inference server for a model

Once an AI model is available through a well known endpoint, it's easy to imagine a new world of applications that will connect and use the AI model. Podman AI Lab support AI applications as a set of containers that are connected together.

Podman AI Lab ships with a so-called Recipes Catalog that helps you navigate a number of core AI use cases and problem domains such as Chat Bots, Code Generators and Text Summarizers. Each recipe comes with detailed explanations and sample applications that can be run with various large language models (LLMs). Experimenting with multiple models allows finding the optimal one for your use case.
